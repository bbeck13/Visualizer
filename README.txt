CPE 471 Final Project
Braden Beck (bnbeck@calpoly.edu)
version 3 - 15 - 2016
--Complete!!

Features:
   The handy run.sh file will setup the build dir and run the example wav file.

   For full usage you can supply up to 4 wav files via the command line and the
   specify the resource dir (default ../resources if you ran the script and are
   in the build dir) as the last argument

   Complete with a Fast Fourier Transform visualization, particle effects and
   bright bouncing balls.

Requirements:
   To run this program you will need the Aquila cpp library available at:
      http://aquila-dsp.org/
   you will also need the glut, glew, glfw, and eigen cpp libraries
      see:
      http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~ssueda/teaching/CSC474/2016W/labs/L00/
      for installation information
   aside from that you will need to have Libcanberra SFML and a lot of other
   software that you will probably already have installed with the operating
   system.

   Speaking of operating systems this software is only confirmed to work on
   linux based operating systems so if your running osx or windows now would
   be a good time to reformat your hardrive and install a real os, (Arch Linux
   is recommended as its the environment I developed this in)
